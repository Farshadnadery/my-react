        <p>
          With more than eight years of experience in graphic design and web
          development, I have been fortunate to have worked closely with
          colleagues and stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am always looking for ways to enhance usersâ€™ experiences which is
          why I am passionate about UX design and enjoy creating UIs that bring
          connective and experiential opportunities to users.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a motivated, life-long learner and my technical background and
          design knowledge have helped me deliver multiple successful projects
          on time over the past many years.
        </p>
